      <p> The project we are doing about identity. Through these classes, we are experimenting between photography, photo shop, coding and all aspects of media studies x photography. I have enjoyed looking around the Korea area and taking 360 degreed photos of our object that we chose. The British Museum is very big, so I expected a lot of fun.  </p>
     
      <p> My object I chose was my favourite CD and the object I chose from the museum was a storage jar, which was passed down generations. The album art of the CD included two grandfathers, so I linked the two together with age/ generation. The aesthetic of the jar was a royal blue on a white jar. The CD aesthetic was white with blues and greys. They fitted in together quite well physically. I liked both of them for their meaning and underlining mention of importance of family.  </p>
      <p>The British Museum has changed, it has become more advance in its technology.It is a lot more involved with students of all ages. Many Primary school's take advantage of the museum- which is easily reachable.   </p>
