      <p> This project has been about identity. Through these sesssions, we are experimenting between photography, photoshop, coding- which are all aspects of media studies x photography. I have enjoyed looking around the Korea exibihtion and taking 360 degrees photos of our object that we chose. Becasue of how big the British Museum is, I thought it was going to be enjoyable yet educational.  </p>
     
      <p> My object I chose was my favourite CD and the object I chose from the museum was a storage jar, which was passed down generations. The album art of the CD included two grandfathers, so I linked the two together with age/ generation. The colour scheme of the jar was a royal blue on a white jar. The theme of the CD was white with blues and greys. They fitted in together quite well physically. I liked both of them for their meaning and underlining mention of importance of family and treasuring what you have, instead of grieveing of what you lack.  </p>
      <p>The British Museum has changed from what i have remembered when I was younger, it has become more advance in its technology.It is a lot more involved with students of all ages. Many Primary school's take advantage of the museum and it's reachability.   </p>
